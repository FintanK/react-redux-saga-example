  <title>React.js, Redux, Redux Saga Counter example</title>
</head>

<body>

  <p>This application provides a basic example of how redux-saga can be applied to a counter.</p>

  <p>The whole state of your app is stored in an object tree inside a single store. The only way to change the state tree
    is to emit an action, an object describing what happened. To specify how the actions transform the state tree, you write
    pure reducers.</p>

  <p>Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.</p>

  <p>It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and
    are easy to test.</p>

  <p>On top of that, it provides a great developer experience, such as live code editing combined with a time traveling debugger.</p>

  <p>You can use Redux together with React, or with any other view library. It is tiny (2kB, including dependencies).</p>
